# Data Analysis and Visualization with R

Welcome to the Data Analysis and Visualization project using R for Choropleth Maps! In this project, we explore and visualize data related to Miles Driven and Life Expectancy across different States using choropleth maps.

## Introduction to Choropleth Maps in Data Science

Choropleth maps are a powerful visualization tool that allows us to represent spatial data by coloring or shading geographic regions. These maps are particularly useful in data science for several reasons:

- **Spatial Patterns:** Choropleth maps help identify spatial patterns and variations in data, allowing us to understand how different regions contribute to overall trends.

- **Geographical Insights:** They provide a clear and intuitive way to communicate geographical insights, making it easier for stakeholders to grasp complex spatial information.

- **Decision-Making Support:** Choropleth maps assist in decision-making by visualizing data in a way that is easy to interpret. They are valuable for exploring regional disparities, identifying outliers, and making informed decisions.

## Part A: Miles Driven Choropleth Map

### 1. Download the Data
Download the dataset 'milesdrive.csv' from the respository.

### 2. Choropleth Map Creation (M13 Plot1)
Create a choropleth map in R to denote the amount of Miles driven in each State. The corresponding R code can be found in M13 Plot1.

## Part B: Life Expectancy Choropleth Maps

### 1. Download the Data
Download the dataset 'lifeexp.csv' from the provided link.

### 2. Choropleth Map for Life Expectancy (M13 Plot2)
Create a choropleth map in R to denote the Life Expectancy in each State. The corresponding R code can be found in M13 Plot2.

### 4. Qualitative Choropleth Map for High Life Expectancy (M13 Plot3)
Create a qualitative choropleth map in R to denote the counties with high Life Expectancy (79 or above) in each State. The corresponding R code can be found in M13 Plot3.
